# The Negative Experience Reframing Tool
The NERT is an open-source, theraputic tool used to **calm your mind, identify cognitive distortions, and feel better** after any kind of negative experience.

I created The NERT based on psychological tools a therapist taught me. These tools have have helped me reframe countless negative experiences and feel better about myself.

My overall goal is to create therapeutic and mindfulness-based applications to help others through their own challenging times with a focus on user experience, accessibility, and data privacy.
